---Steps needed for running 'fix_matlab_eps.py'---
(https://github.com/Sbte/fix_matlab_eps)

1. After following all install instructions for Inkscape and XQuartz it was necessary for me to create a symlink for Inkscape in the PATH :
ln -s /Applications/Inkscape.app/Contents/Resources/bin/inkscape   /usr/local/bin/inkscape
(and be sure to link 'inkscape' not 'inkscape-bin')
(http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22085168/inkscape-command-line-where-is-it-on-mac)

2. When testing python code that calls inkscape, specify full paths of image and vector files being loaded.

3. Add '/usr/local/bin/' to the PATH in matlab
(https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/run-external-commands-scripts-and-programs.html)

path1 = getenv('PATH')
path1 = [path1 ':/usr/local/bin']
setenv('PATH', path1)
!echo $PATH 

4. Repair libtiff library (this might have been specific to my machine)
(kyamagu/mexopencv#250)

backed up original file to: /Applications/MATLAB_R2016a.app/bin/maci64/backup_libtiff.5.dylib
simlinked from: /usr/local/opt/libtiff/lib/libtiff.5.dylib

5. install ghostscript
http://brewformulas.org/Ghostscript

6. You should be able to run fix_matlab.eps.py now.
For Example see <zlab_codebase>/Dene/active/miscellaneous/fix_image_output/fix_matlab_eps/image_output_scratchpad.m
