fix_Matlab2014bplus_pdf_output.m fixes Matlab pdf output issues
that exist for all Matlab versions 2014b and later.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Adobe Illustrator
- Mac OS
(you can still run the jsx script from Windows, but you need to
figure out how to feed it to Adobe Illustrator from the commandline)

For best results (DO THESE STEPS BEFORE RUNNING THIS FUN):
1. Isolate the pdfs that you need to fix into their own directory.
2. Change directory to that location in Matlab.
3. Close all files that are open in Adobe Illustrator.
4. Close the Adobe Illustrator application if it is open.
5. Close ExtendScript Toolkit if it is open.
6. Close Apple Script Editor if it is open.
7. Run this function (fix_Matlab2014b_pdf_output.m)
8. Be patient - For PDFs that have been fractured into thousands of paths it can take up to an hour
`  to run the repair jsx script. You should see console output in the JavaScript Console
`  in the ExtendScript Toolkit Interface, which automatically loads up when Adobe Illustrator
`  is told to run the jsx fix script.

***I'm not sure why it takes so long. Coding this fix entailed navigating multiple blackbox problems
created by the coupling of two proprietary softwares, Mathworks and Adobe. 

If you're experienced in programming scripts for Adobe applications or javascript,
please inspect my javascript function and try to speed it up. 
I am not an expert, just tried to fix a problem.

---The jsx file is located:
./fix_matlab_pdfs__jsx_plus_ai/fixMatlabPDFOutput.jsx

TESTED ON:
Mac Pro Desktop
OS 10.10.5
MATLAB Version: 9.0.0.341360 (R2016a)
Adobe Illustrator CS6

Workflow: [Going from Top to Bottom]
-	      (Matlab) fix_Matlab2014bplus_pdf_output.m
-	      			** CALLS ** 
-	      (bash script) shell_script_illustrator.sh
-	      			** CALLS ** 
-	      (Adobe Illustrator) [loading file and running jsx script]
-	      			** CALLS ** 
-	      (ExtendScript Toolkit) fixMatlabPDFOutput.jsx
-	      			** Implements ** 
-	      (Adobe Illustrator) emulating actions described in jsx script

Text outputs are routed to the Matlab Command Window
so you should be able to see all of this happening from Matlab.
